<p>To fix the issue, add the following key-value pair to Hiera:</p>
<p><code>puppet_enterprise::master::disable_i18n: false</code></p>
<p>The location depends on how you’ve set up Hiera, but you can add it to <code>common.yaml</code>, which is by default located at <code>/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/common.yaml</code></p>
