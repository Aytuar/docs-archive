# Run the support script for Puppet Enterprise 2016.2 to 2019.7
<p>When you work with Support, we might ask you to gather troubleshooting information using the command <code>puppet enterprise support</code>. The command runs a script that collects a large amount of system information, compresses it into a tarball, and outputs the location of the tarball when it finishes running.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can <a href="https://support.puppet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037742474">choose the diagnostics run by the support script to create a smaller tarball with more targeted information</a> if you are using Puppet Enterprise 2018.1.11 and later 2018.1, 2019.1.3 and later 2019.1, and 2019.2.0 and later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can <a href="https://support.puppet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003312887">obfuscate hostnames and IP addresses in Support Script output using SOScleaner</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Our terminology changed. A primary server was formerly called a master of masters or a master. A compiler was formerly called a compile master.</p>
