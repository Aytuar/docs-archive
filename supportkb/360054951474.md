# Using the Puppet Enterprise console to work with classes and configuration in Puppet Enterprise 2019.8.0
<p>I want to follow documented steps for working with classes and configuration data in Puppet Enterprise 2019.8.0, but the documentation refers to tabs that don’t appear in my version of the console.</p>
<h3 id="version-and-installation-information">Version and installation information</h3>
<p><strong>PE version:</strong> 2019.8.0</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>PE 2019.8.1 introduced changes to the node groups interface in the console. However, the steps in the PE documentation describe only the latest version of a given PE release.</p>
<p>Notably, the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab was broken out into two tabs, <strong>Classes</strong> and <strong>Configuration data</strong>. Other than these interface changes, there is no functional difference in working with classes and configuration data between 2019.8.0 and later versions of PE.</p>
<p>Here’s how to follow the steps in the documentation if you’re using PE 2019.8.0:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Action</td>
<td>2019.8 documentation</td>
<td>2019.8.0 interface</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Setting parameters or applying classes</td>
<td>In the <strong>Classes</strong> tab</td>
<td>In the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab’s <strong>Classes</strong> section</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Setting configuration data in the console</td>
<td>In the <strong>Configuration data</strong> tab</td>
<td>In the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab’s <strong>Data</strong> section</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
