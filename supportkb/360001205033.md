# Resolve SSL errors when connecting to GitHub using the r10k shellgit provider in Puppet Enterprise
<p><a href="https://github.blog/2018-02-02-weak-cryptographic-standards-removal-notice/">GitHub has dropped support for the TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 protocols</a> as of February, 22nd 2018 leaving TLSv1.2 and newer as the only valid options for HTTPS traffic. Puppet Enterprise has shipped with an OpenSSL library that supports TLSv1.2 since the 2015.2.1 version of PE. However, integrations that use libraries provided by the operating system, such as the <code>shellgit</code> provider for r10k or Code Manager, may be affected on older versions of RedHat 6 and 7 variants (RHEL, CentOS, OEL, etc.) along with SLES 11.</p>

<p>Failure when deploying a module:</p>
<pre><code>INFO     -&gt; Deploying Puppetfile content /etc/puppetlabs/code-staging/environments/production/modules/jmx

<p>Failure when syncing a control repository:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR        -&gt; Unable to determine current branches for Git source 'puppet' (/etc/puppetlabs/code-staging/environments)
Original exception:

<p>In both cases a “HTTP request failed” error is reported. Re-running the <code>Command:</code> with extra logging enabled via the <code>GIT_CURL_VERBOSE</code> environment variable will reveal additional details about the failure.</p>
<p>For example, a CentOS 6.5 node might return:</p>
<pre><code># sudo -u pe-puppet GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git --git-dir /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/code-manager/git/https---ucwfe2agnu9dp8e.delivery.puppetlabs.net-root-control-repo.git fetch origin --prune

<p>In this case, LibNSS returned an error code of -5961 indicating that the connection was terminated by the remote server.</p>
<h2 id="version-and-installation-information">Version and installation information</h2>
<p><strong>PE version:</strong> Any.<br><strong>OS:</strong> RedHat variants 7.1 and earlier, RedHat variants 6.7 and earlier, SLES 11.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<h3 id="use-the-rugged-provider">Use the rugged provider</h3>
<p>If possible, configure Code Manager or r10k to use the <code>rugged</code> git provider instead of the <code>shellgit</code> provider. The <code>rugged</code> provider is linked against the OpenSSL library bundled with PE and will be able to use TLSv1.2.</p>
<h3 id="fix-shellgit-by-updating-os-packages">Fix shellgit by updating OS packages</h3>
<p>If the use of <code>shellgit</code> is required, then the operating system may need to be updated to a newer release along with packages that provide the libraries used by git to make HTTPS requests.</p>
<p>Facter can be used to check the operating system release:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/puppetlabs/bin/facter os.release</code></pre>
<p>And Puppet can be used to check package versions:</p>
<pre><code>/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet resource package</code></pre>
<h4 id="redhat-6">RedHat 6</h4>
<p>Operating systems derived from RedHat 6 will need to be updated to release 6.8 or later in order to access packages that support TLSv1.2. Once the OS is upgraded, the minimum required package versions for RedHat 6 systems are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>curl-7.19.7-50.el6</code></li>
<li><code>nss-3.19.1-6.el6</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="redhat-7">RedHat 7</h4>
<p>Operating systems derived from RedHat 7 will need to be updated to release 7.2 or later in order to access packages that support TLSv1.2. Once the OS is upgraded, the minimum required package versions for RedHat 7 systems are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>curl-7.29.0-24.el7</code></li>
<li><code>nss-3.19.1-14.el7</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sles-11">SLES 11</h4>
<p>SLES 11 ships with OpenSSL 0.9.8, which is too old to support TLSv1.2. An updated build of OpenSSL that supports TLSv1.2 is available from the Security Module repository for SLES 11 Service Pack 3 and SP4. However, Puppet Support has not been able to verify that this updated Package is picked up by git — consider contacting SUSE support for more details.</p>
