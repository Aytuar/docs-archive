# Firewall rules appear in reverse order when using MCollective to kick off Puppet runs in Puppet Enterprise 3.8 to 2017.2
<p>After using MCollective to kick off a Puppet run, you can't connect to nodes in my deployment. You set up firewall rules correctly, but when you run <code>iptables -L</code> or look at <code>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</code>, they are listed in reverse order. </p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>If you use MCollective to kick off Puppet runs (<code>mco puppet runonce -I agent.example.com</code>) while also using the <a href="https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/firewall"><code>puppetlabs-firewall</code></a> module, your firewall rules might be listed in reverse order. MCollective prevents PE from handling the output of forked commands (in this case, <code>iptables-save</code>) correctly, causing firewall rules to be in the wrong order.</p>
<p>In many firewall configurations, the last rule drops all packets. If this rule is listed first, network connectivity fails.</p>
<p>To prevent this issue, do not use MCollective to kick off Puppet runs. Use any of the following instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>puppet agent -t</code> on the command line.</li>
<li>Use a Cron job.</li>
<li>Click <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/main/pe/2017.2/console_classes_groups_running_puppet.md#run-puppet-on-a-node-from-the-console">Run Puppet</a> in the console.</li>
</ul>
