# Keep MCollective facts updated on Windows for Puppet Enterprise 2016.2
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Puppet Enterprise 2018.1 was the last release to support Marionette Collective, also known as MCollective. Future releases of PE do not include MCollective.</p>
<p>To prepare for these changes, <a title="Migrate MCollective" href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/main/pe/2018.1/migrating_from_mcollective_to_orchestrator.md">migrate your MCollective work to Puppet orchestrator</a> to automate tasks and create consistent, repeatable administrative processes. Use orchestrator to automate your workflows and take advantage of its integration with Puppet Enterprise console and commands, APIs, role-based access control, and event tracking.</p>
<hr>
<p>Facts aren’t syncing to MCollective. You used <code>mco puppet runonce -F &lt;fact_name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;</code> to trigger a change using facts, but MCollective isn’t finding any nodes. You need to sync facts and make sure MCollective stays up to date as you add new facts. </p>
<h3 id="version-and-installation-information">Version and installation information</h3>
<p><strong>PE version:</strong> 2016.2<br><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>There are two ways to update facts for MCollective in Windows:</p>
<p><strong>Do a one-time sync of facts</strong></p>
<p>Run the following <code>.bat</code> file: <code>C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\mcollective\etc\refresh-mcollective-metadata.bat</code></p>
<p><strong>Increase the frequency of the scheduled task updating facts</strong></p>
<p>By default, the Windows scheduled task that syncs facts used with MCollective only runs once a day. Increase how frequently the scheduled task runs by managing a new scheduled task with PE.</p>
<p>The default manifest that manages the frequency of the scheduled task is <code>puppet_enterprise::mcollective::server::facter</code>, which is located in <code>/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules/puppet_enterprise/manifests/mcollective/server/facter.pp</code></p>
<p>You shouldn’t change the frequency of the task in this manifest since it will be overwritten, but it provides an example of a scheduled task that refreshes MCollective facts, which you can use to solve your issue.</p>
<pre>include puppet_enterprise::params

$mco_etc = $puppet_enterprise::params::mco_etc

scheduled_task { 'custom-pe-mcollective-metadata':
      ensure  =&gt; 'present',
      command =&gt; "${mco_etc}/refresh-mcollective-metadata.bat",
      enabled =&gt; true,
      trigger =&gt; {
        'every'      =&gt; '1',
        'schedule'   =&gt; 'daily',
        'start_time' =&gt; '13:00'
      },
    }</pre>
<p>Increase the frequency of the task by adding the same scheduled task to your own class and editing the <code>trigger attribute</code> to add the <code>minutes_interval</code> key under the <code>start time</code> key. For example, to run the task every 30 minutes:</p>
<pre>include puppet_enterprise::params

$mco_etc = $puppet_enterprise::params::mco_etc

scheduled_task { 'custom-pe-mcollective-metadata':
      ensure  =&gt; 'present',
      command =&gt; "${mco_etc}/refresh-mcollective-metadata.bat",
      enabled =&gt; true,
      trigger =&gt; {
        'every'      =&gt; '1',
        'schedule'   =&gt; 'daily',
        'start_time' =&gt; '13:00'
        'minutes_interval' =&gt; '30'
      },
    }</pre>
