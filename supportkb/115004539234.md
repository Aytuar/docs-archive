<p>While performing a security scan, you might see Puppet Enterprise vulnerable to CVE-2017-15059. This unsafe deserialization vulnerability was found in the <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1599"><code>jackson-databind</code></a> package.

<p><strong>PE version:</strong> 2016.4.0 to 2016.4.9, 2017.2, 2017.3.0 to 2017.3.2<br><strong>OS:</strong> *nix<br><strong>Installation type:</strong> Monolothic, monolothic with compile masters, split</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>This issue was fixed in PE 2016.4.10 and later 2016.4, and was fixed in PE 2017.3.4 and all later versions.</p>
<p>We only use <code>jackson-databind</code> as a transitive dependency and we do not use <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization">global typing</a> in Java.</p>
<p>Puppet Server: The package is only being used for encoding and the vulnerability affects decoding and deserialization.</p>
<p>PuppetDB: We use the package as a transitive dependency, therefore not being vulnerable.</p>
<p>Orchestrator: The package is being used as a transitive dependency, therefore not being vulnerable.</p>
