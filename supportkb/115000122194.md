# The KahaDB directory fills up and prevents PuppetDB from working in Puppet Enterprise 2016.4.5 and all earlier versions, or 2016.5
<p>Due to a <a href="https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PDB-3511">known issue</a>, when the directory at <code>/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetdb/mq/localhost/KahaDB</code> reaches the configurable disk limit (around 100GB), PuppetDB's internal message queue can't accept new commands. PuppetDB then stops functioning and can't accept incoming connections. Agent nodes can't check in and the PE console won't update.</p>
<p>This issue is fixed in PE 2016.4.6 (and later versions in the 2016.4 series) and PE 2017.1 (and later).</p>
