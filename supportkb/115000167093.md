# Upgrading to Puppet Enterprise 2016.4.x from PE 2015.3 and earlier fails with a "java.lang.AssertionError: Assert failed: the secret key must be exactly 16 bytes error"
<p>In rare cases, during upgrades to Puppet Enterprise 2016.4.x from PE 2015.3 and earlier, the upgrade might fail with a <code>java.lang.AssertionError: Assert failed: the secret key must be exactly 16 bytes</code> error.</p>
<p>This issue does not affect upgrades to version 2016.5.x and later.</p>
<h3 id="error-messages">Error messages</h3>
<p><code>java.lang.AssertionError: Assert failed: the secret key must be exactly 16 bytes</code></p>
<p>If the PE console cookie secret key is generated and only includes numbers, the HOCON parser treats it as a number (not a string), causing installation to fail when the data is used.</p>

<p><strong>PE version:</strong> 2016.4.x</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>To resolve the issue:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>
<p>On the master, delete the cookie secret key (<code>/etc/puppetlabs/console-services/conf.d/console_secret_key.conf</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the installer again. This will generate a new cookie secret key and complete the installation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
