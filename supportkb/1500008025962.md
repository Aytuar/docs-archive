<p>This message is observed in the Docker logs of the failed containers, indicating a timeout connecting to UDP port 53 which is commonly used for DNS:</p>

<h3 id="version-and-installation-information">Version and installation information</h3>
<p><strong>Product:</strong> Puppet Remediate</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.4, 2.0</p>
<p><strong>Installation type:</strong> Offline installation (using <code>-o</code>, <code>--offline</code> flag)</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Before starting Remediate in offline mode, in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, if there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolv.conf">nameserver entries</a>, ensure that at least one of them is reachable from the Docker host. Offline mode can continue to work with no nameserver entries. In <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, comment out or remove all unreachable nameservers entries.</p>
