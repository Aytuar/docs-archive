# "Pe_repo" error during Puppet runs after installing Bolt on a primary server in Puppet Enterprise 
<p>I installed Bolt on my primary node (called the master in versions of PE earlier than 2019.8), and Iâ€™m getting a <code>Pe_repo</code> error during agent runs.</p>
<h3 id="error-messages">Error messages</h3>
<p>When Bolt is installed, the open-source Puppet agent repo is enabled. The open-source agent package might be a later version than the PE agent package installed on your primary server. Then, a yum update causes the repo to use the latest version of the Puppet agent, and you get an error during the agent run.</p>
