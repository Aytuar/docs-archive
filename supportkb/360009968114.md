# "fast_gettext" error in Puppet Enterprise when upgrading from Puppet agent 5.3.3 (PE 2017.3.2) and earlier to 5.3.4 (PE 2017.3.4) and later
<p>I get a <code>fast_gettext</code> error when upgrading Puppet agent from 5.3.3 (PE 2017.3.2) to 5.3.4 (PE 2017.3.4). How do I resolve it?</p>
<h3 id="error-messages-and-logs">Error messages and logs</h3>
<p>During upgrade, the <code>fast_gettext</code> 1.1.0 localization gem is removed and replaced with <code>fast_gettext</code> 1.1.2. When the agent runs, string translation fails because a file in the older version of the gem no longer exists, and you get the following error:</p>
<p><code>Error: Could not convert change ensure to string: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/fast_gettext-1.1.0/lib/fast_gettext/vendor/empty.mo Error: No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/ruby/gems/2.4.0/gems/fast_gettext-1.1.0/lib/fast_gettext/vendor/empty.mo</code></p>

<p><strong>PE version:</strong> 2017.3.2 and earlier upgrading to 2017.3.4 and later</p>

<p>This error can safely be ignored. The error occurs only during upgrade and will not occur during subsequent runs.</p>
