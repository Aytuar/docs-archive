# Remove unnecessary packages installed on infrastructure nodes and compile masters during Puppet runs in Puppet Enterprise 2016.4, 2017.3, 2018.1, and 2019.2
<p>During Puppet runs on my compile master, pe-puppetdb and pe-postgresql packages are installed. My compile master is not a PuppetDB node. I want to prevent these packages from being installed during Puppet runs and remove them from the node.</p>

<p>You might see this issue on any infrastructure node other than a monolithic master.</p>

<h3 id="version-and-installation-information">Version and installation information</h3>
<p><strong>PE version:</strong> 2016.4, 2017.3, 2018.1, 2019.2<br><strong>OS:</strong> Any <strong><br>Installation type:</strong> <br>2016.4, 2017.3, 2018.1, 2019.2: Monolithic with compile masters or a separate PE PostgreSQL, split <br>2019.2: compile masters or a separate PE PostgreSQL</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The <code>puppet_enterprise</code> module uses virtual resources to manage Puppet Enterprise (PE) packages for all infrastructure nodes (the master of masters, compile master, PuppetDB, and console). When a package resource collector is used on any PE infrastructure node, it adds all of the infrastructure packages to that node.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, find the resource collectors present in the code base and update them to omit these PE packages. Remove the unnecessary packages from systems that are affected.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Find the package resource collectors causing the issue:</p>
<p><code>find $(puppet config print codedir) -name "*.pp" -exec grep -HE 'Package\s+&lt;\|' {} \;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add title filters to each resource collector applied to PE infrastructure nodes to make sure unnecessary packages are not added. This example includes all of the pe-packages. To avoid the issue, you will need to combine these filters with any search expression you are already using.</p>
<pre><code>Package &lt;| title != 'pe-postgresql-pglogical' and
       title != 'pe-java' and
       title != 'pe-puppetdb' and
       title != 'pe-console-services' and
       title != 'pe-client-tools' and
       title != 'pe-orchestration-services' and
       title != 'pe-activemq' and
       title != 'pe-puppet-enterprise-release' and
       title != 'pe-razor-server' and
       title != 'pe-razor-libs' and 
       title != 'pe-backup-tools' and 
       title != 'pe-console-services-termini' and 
       title != 'pe-license' and  
       title != 'pe-modules' and 
       title != 'pe-puppetdb-termini' and 
       title != 'pe-puppetserver' and  
       title != 'pe-postgresql-common' and

<li>
<p>Remove unnecessary packages from the affected nodes.</p>
<p>In our example, the compile master had pe-postgresql-pglogical, pe-puppetdb, pe-console-services, pe-orchestration-services, pe-activemq, pe-razor-libs, and pe-razor-server installed. In this case, remove them by running the following on the compile master:</p>
<p><code># if $(grep -qE '^subname = //localhost' /etc/puppetlabs/puppetdb/conf.d/database.ini); then for package in pe-postgresql-pglogical pe-puppetdb; do puppet resource package $package ensure=absent; done; else /bin/echo "This server appears to be a PuppetDB node. Not removing packages."; fi</code></p>
<p><code># if [ ! -s /etc/puppetlabs/console-services/conf.d/console.conf ]; then puppet resource package pe-console-services ensure=absent; else /bin/echo "ERROR: This server appears to be a Console node. Not removing packages."; fi</code></p>
<p><code># if [ `ls /etc/puppetlabs/razor-server |wc -l` -le 2 ]; then for package in pe-razor-server pe-razor-libs; do puppet resource package $package
ensure=absent; done; else /bin/echo "ERROR: This server appears to have Razor configured. Not removing packages."; fi</code></p>
<p><code># if ! $(grep -qE 'Centrally managed by Puppet' /etc/puppetlabs/activemq/activemq.xml); then puppet resource package pe-activemq ensure=absent; else /bin/echo "This server appears to have a managed ActiveMQ configuration. Not removing package."; fi<br></code></p>
<p><code># if [ "`puppet config print certname`" != "`puppet config print server`" ]; then puppet resource package pe-orchestration-services ensure=absent; else /bin/echo "This server appears to be a Puppet master of masters. Not removing package."; fi</code></p>
</li>
