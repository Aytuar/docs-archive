# Fix an “ERROR -> Unable to connect to https://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com” when authenticating with the Forge in Puppet Enterprise
<p>If you have an old or broken SSL stack and you try to authenticate with the Forge via SSL, you might get the following error: <code>ERROR -&gt; Unable to connect to https://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com</code>.</p>
<h3 id="version-and-installation-information">Version and installation information</h3>
<p><strong>PE version:</strong> All versions</p>
<p>You can fix the error by updating r10k.yaml and update to point <code>baseurl</code> to forgeapi.puppet.com (instead of forgeapi.puppetlabs.com) <a href="https://forgeapi.puppet.com/#section/Hostname-Configuration">as described in the Forge API documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The Forge API is now primarily served from the puppet.com domain (r10k still points to the puppetlabs.com domain). DNS still resolves for puppetlabs.com. However, the legacy *.puppetlabs.com wildcard certificate was removed so that we could provide secure access to the Forge using SSL certificate best practices. <a href="https://headwayapp.co/puppet-forge-updates/removed-legacy-*-puppetlabs-com-ssl-certificate-143941">Read this Forge update for more details</a>.</p>
<p>In most cases, your interaction with the Forge won’t change because the puppet.com certificate includes puppetlabs.com as a SAN (Subject Alternative Name). However, if you’re using an older stack without support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">server name indication (SNI)</a> to access modules on the Forge, this change prevents SSL validation.</p>
<p>This has been corrected upstream in <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k/pull/1066">pull requests 1066</a> and <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k/pull/1067">1067</a> and will be in a future release.</p>
