# Node classifier: Agents unresponsive to mco ping in Puppet Enterprise 3.8
<p>When I upgraded to PE 3.8, my agents appeared in Live Management, but then disappeared. Puppet runs are completing successfully on all nodes, but my agents aren’t responding to <code>mco ping.</code></p>
<h3>Version and installation information</h3>
<p><strong>PE version:</strong> 3.8.0</p>
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<p>This happens when your agents aren’t in the PE MCollective node group. This node group is used to enable MCollective on nodes and allows them to appear in Live Management. To fix the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into the console.</li>
<li>In the top navigation bar, click <strong>Classification</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>PE MCollective </strong>node group.</li>
<li>Check the node rules and pinned nodes for PE MCollective to see if your agent nodes are included in the group. If they are not, add them.</li>
<li>To add all nodes, including the agent nodes, add the following rule:<br><br><img src="https://support.puppet.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/202783784/mcollective_console.png" alt=""><br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Some nodes, such as non-root nodes or network devices, should not have orchestration enabled. You can create rules in this node group to exclude these nodes from orchestration. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/main/pe/3.8/console_classes_groups.markdown#adding-nodes-dynamically">Grouping and classifying nodes: Adding nodes dynamically</a>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add Rule</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Commit</strong>.</li>
<li>Wait a few minutes for the changes to take effect.</li>
<li>Log in as the peadmin user and run <code>mco ping</code> from the console node. If the agent nodes are still unresponsive, see <a href="https://support.puppet.com/hc/en-us/articles/205163450">MCollective: Basic troubleshooting</a>.</li>
