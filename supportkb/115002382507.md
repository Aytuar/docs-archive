<p>During upgrade to PE 2016.5, the <code>migration-user</code> setting is added to <code>/etc/puppetlabs/console-services/conf.d/classifier-database.conf</code>. You get this error when the <code>console-services</code> package is not updated during upgrade.</p>
<p>In the installation log, located at <code>/var/log/puppetlabs/installer/install_log.lastrun.&lt;hostname&gt;.log</code> on the machine from which you are running the installer:</p>
<p><code>[Warning]: Puppet::Type::Package::ProviderYum: Could not check for updates, '/usr/bin/yum check-update' exited with 1</code></p>
<p>This error indicates that during the upgrade, none of the PE packages were updated.</p>
