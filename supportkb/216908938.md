# PYCURL and repository metadata errors during an agent upgrade in Puppet Enterprise 2015.2
<p>While upgrading my agent to 2015.2.2, I received a PYCURL error and can't complete the installation.</p>
<h3 id="error-messages-and-logs">Error messages and logs</h3>
<p><code>[Errno 14] PYCURL ERROR 22 - "NSS: client certificate not found (nickname not specified)" Trying other mirror. Error: Cannot retrieve repository metadata (repomd.xml) for repository: pe_repo. Please verify its path and try again</code></p>
<p>These errors occur when permissions on the installation directory are incorrect. In order for the agent to upgrade successfully, permissions on the directory and its subdirectories must be <code>755 (drwxr-xr-x)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This error can occur during upgrade or installation.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Check and correct the permissions on the agent installer directory:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Log into the master as root.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check what the permissions for the agent installation directory and subdirectories are by running <code>find /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/packages/public -type d -ls</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the permissions for the directory and its subdirectories are not 755 (drwxr-xr-x), change them to 755 by running <code>chmod -R 755 /opt/puppetlabs/server/data/packages/public</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade the agent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
