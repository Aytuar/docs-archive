<!-- Stopping processes to reduce the number of pending tasks for Puppet Enterprise 3.3.x to 3.8.x - Suzie Baunsgard -->
<p><strong>PE version:</strong> 3.8.1, 3.8.0, 3.7.2, 3.7.0, 3.3.2</p>
<p>When dashboard reports have stopped running, the number of pending tasks can greatly increase. To reduce the number of pending tasks, stop the dashboard workers by doing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into the console node as root.<br><br>
</li>
<li>To see the list of <code>delayed_job</code> and <code>delayed_job_monitor</code> processes, run <code>ps aux | grep delayed</code>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Stop the dashboard workers service by running <code>puppet resource service pe-puppet-dashboard-workers ensure=stop</code>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>To see an updated list of delayed processes, run <code>ps aux | grep delayed</code>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Kill any remaining <code>delayed_job_monitor</code> and <code>delayed_job</code> processes. <br><br>
</li>
<li>Run <code>ls -l /opt/puppet/share/puppet-dashboard/tmp/pids/*.pid</code>. Remove any <code>.pid</code> files that you find.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Restart the dashboard workers process by running <code>puppet resource service pe-puppet-dashboard-workers ensure=running</code>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>To see check if there are any remaining delayed processes, run <code>ps aux | grep delayed</code>.</li>
</ol>
