# Configuring and adding integrations

Configure your Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) instance so that it communicates with your source control system, Puppet Enterprise, and the job hardware you use to run tests on your Puppet code.

-   **[Integrate with source control](integrations.md#)**  
Integrate your source control system with Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) by following the appropriate set of instructions on this page.
-   **[Integrate with Puppet Enterprise](integrate_with_puppet_enterprise.md#)**  
To set up an integration between your Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) instance and Continuous Delivery for PE, you must first set up a dedicated PE user with appropriate permissions, then add your PE instance's credentials to Continuous Delivery for PE.
-   **[Configure impact analysis](configure_impact_analysis.md#)**
