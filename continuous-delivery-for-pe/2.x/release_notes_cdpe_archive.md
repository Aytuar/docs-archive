# Release notes archive

Release notes for Continuous Delivery for PE 2.x release series versions that are more than six months past the most recent 2.x release version are housed in the release notes archive.

## Version 2.9.1

Released 30 April 2019

Resolved in this release:

-   MySQL users were unable to run Continuous Delivery for PE version 2.9.0.


## Version 2.9.0

Released 30 April 2019

New in this release:

-   **Pipeline stage status shown in your source control system.** The status of each stage of the relevant pipeline is now shown alongside a commit or pull request in your source control system.

-   **Master branch creation for new modules.** When you add a new module to Continuous Delivery for PE, the software now checks to see if the module contains a master branch. If no master branch is present, Continuous Delivery for PE offers to create one for you from an existing branch of your choosing. For more on the master branch and its importance, see [Git branches and Continuous Delivery for PE](introducing_deployments.md#).

-   **Name a newly created pipeline stage.** To assign a custom name to a newly created pipeline stage, fill in the **Name** field when adding the new stage.
-   **Usability improvements.** We've made numerous small usability improvements, including:

-   If an impact analysis task fails, a **Failed** message is now shown in the pipeline and events views.

-   You can now show or hide the value of your GitHub Enterprise token when adding credentials.


Resolved in this release:

-   Due to a Firefox known issue, Firefox users saw a blank screen when opening a message in the message center.

-   When editing the later stages of a long pipeline, the editing modal often appeared above the visible area of the browser window.

-   Clicking **Edit Deployment** ![](edit.png) too soon after a new page load caused an error.

-   A non-descriptive error was shown when you attempted to deploy to a node group that didn't contain any nodes.

-   When adding new PE credentials, relevant fields were not displayed for manual entry of information not automatically discovered by Continuous Delivery for PE.

-   The **Edit Impact Analysis** screen did not accurately show the environments you chose to run impact analysis tasks on.


## Version 2.8.2

Released 25 April 2019

Resolved in this release:

-   The Continuous Delivery agent was unable to successfully clone repositories from GitHub. To fix this issue, [Update the Continuous Delivery agent](configure_job_hardware.md#) to the latest version.


## Version 2.8.1

Released 18 April 2019

Important security notice:

-   **Root passwords were exposed in the PE console for some users.** If you used the **cd4pe::root\_configuration** task to configure your Continuous Delivery for PE installation, the root user's username and password were exposed in the job's **Job Details** pane in the PE console. To fix this issue, upgrade the `puppetlabs-cd4pe` module to [version 1.2.1](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/cd4pe) and [reset the root user's password](the_root_console.md#).


## Version 2.8.0

Released 15 April 2019

Important notice for users upgrading to version 2.8.0:

-   **A Continuous Delivery agent upgrade is required on all SELinux-enabled job hardware.** This version features improved support for distribution-packaged Docker on hosts with SELinux enabled. Mounting volumes from the host to the Continuous Delivery for PE container now tells SELinux to allow the container access to the volume mount. If you have SELinux enabled, you must upgrade your Continuous Delivery agents. For instructions, see [Upgrade the Continuous Delivery agent](configure_job_hardware.md#).


New in this release:

-   **View a control repo or module's event history sorted by pipeline run.** You can now choose to view the event history for your control repo or module by pipeline run, rather than by chronological event. To get started, choose **View history by: Pipeline** on your control repo or module's **Events** pane.

    **Note:** If you're upgrading to Continuous Delivery for PE version 2.8.0, please note that we are unable to retroactively sort your event history from previous versions of the software into pipeline runs. Only pipeline runs triggered using version 2.8.0 and newer versions are shown in the pipeline view.

-   **Automatic Git branch creation when deploying a module to an environment without a matching branch.** When you deploy a module to an environment for which a matching Git branch does not yet exist, Continuous Delivery for PE now creates the branch for you.

-   **Set a deployment's timeout duration.** When creating a new deployment, you can now specify the length of the deployment's timeout period. By default, deployments time out after 60 minutes.

-   **Name your pipeline stages.** You can now provide custom names for the stages in your control repo and module pipelines. To name or rename a pipeline stage, click the **More Actions** ![](kebab.png) menu and select**Rename Stage**.

-   **Support for custom CA certificates for GitHub Enterprise.** When setting up your GitHub Enterprise integration, you now have the option to provide a custom CA certificate, such as a self-signed certificate.

-   **Usability improvements.** We've made numerous small usability improvements, including:

-   The description you provide for a manually triggered module deployment is now shown in the module's events timeline and on the deployment's details page.


Resolved in this release:

-   If you enabled SAML and then ran a configuration test, SAML was disabled until you re-saved the integration.

-   A display error occurred if you reordered the stages of a default pipeline while the pipeline contained stage placeholders.

-   When using GitHub EnterpriseÂ with self-signed certificates, an error was shown when you ran a job.


Removed in this release:

-   **Dispatch a job.** We've removed the ability to manually dispatch a job from the Jobs page.


## Version 2.7.1

Released 2 April 2019

Resolved in this release:

-   When manually triggering a regex branch pipeline for a control repo, the branch selection section of the **Run Pipeline** page was unresponsive.


## Version 2.7.0

Released 1 April 2019

New in this release:

-   **Default pipelines.** When creating a new pipeline for a control repo or module, Continuous Delivery for PE now offers to set up a default pipeline for you. Default pipelines contain recommended stages along with prompts to build out the pipeline's functionality. You can edit and rearrange the elements of the default pipeline to suit your needs. To get started, click **+ Add default pipeline** when creating a new pipeline.

-   **SSL support.** To learn how to set up SSL for your Continuous Delivery for PE instance, see [Configure SSL](configure_ssl.md#).

-   **Notification of upcoming token expiration.**You'll receive a notification in the message center ![](message.png) when yourPE token is two weeks from its expiration date, and another notification if the token expires.

-   **Updated guidance and new default queries for setting up regex branch pipelines.**These changes are designed to help you avoid accidentally triggering the regex branch pipeline when changes are deployed to your environment branches.

-   **Usability improvements.** We've made numerous small usability improvements, including:

-   You are no longer required to generate and enter a new PE token when adding or editing impact analysis credentials after integrating your PE instance.

-   Improved messaging when configuring storage in the root console.


Deprecated in this release:

-   **Incremental branch and blue-green branch deployment policies.** The incremental branch and blue-green branch deployment policies have been deprecated. These deployment policies will be removed from Continuous Delivery for PE in a future release.

-   **Support for Puppet Enterprise version 2017.3.** PE 2017.3 has reached the end of its support lifecycle.


## Version 2.6.0

Released 18 March 2019

New in this release:

-   **Module deployments.** You can now deploy module changes to your Puppet environments using your module's pipeline. In order to deploy module code, you must first add a `:branch => :control_branch` declaration to the module's section of your Puppetfile. See [Deploy module code](deploy_module.md) for more information.

-   **Master branch creation for new control repos.** When you add a new control repo to Continuous Delivery for PE, the software now checks to see if the control repo contains a master branch. If no master branch is present, Continuous Delivery for PE offers to create one for you from an existing branch of your choosing. For more on the master branch and its importance, see [Git branches and Continuous Delivery for PE](introducing_deployments.md#).

-   **No-op runs for deployments.** When creating a new deployment for a control repo, you now have the option to set the deployment to run in no-op mode. No-op deployments are not available for regex pipelines or deployments using the eventual consistency deployment policy.

-   **Redesigned** **Puppet Enterprise** **account settings page.** The **Puppet Enterprise** account settings page now displays each connected PE instance's node classifier address, number of protected environments, and token expiration date.

-   **Specify the lifetime of your** PE **token.** When adding new PE credentials using basic authorization, you can now customize the lifetime of the PE token Continuous Delivery for PE generates for you.

-   **Regenerate a PE token.** On the Puppet Enterprise account settings page, click **Regenerate** to enter a new API token or provide your PE credentials to have a new token generated for you.

-   **Usability improvements.** We've made numerous small usability improvements, including:

-   Improved messaging when setting up a deployment using the feature branch policy.

-   No longer requiring a deployment description when adding a deployment to a pipeline stage,

-   Reorganized the steps for creating a new deployment for a more logical flow.


Resolved in this release:

-   All deployments with stagger settings ran batches of 10 nodes at a time, rather than the number of nodes specified when the deployment was created.

-   The **Update Ref** section of the deployment details page was not displayed for deployments using the eventual consistency deployment policy.

-   Terminate conditions were not shown on the deployment details page for deployments using the direct merge deployment policy.


## Version 2.5.0

Released 4 March 2019

New in this release:

-   **Deploy code from a regex branch pipeline to a feature branch Puppet environment.** You can now add a deployment to your regex branch pipeline. When triggered, this deployment uses the Feature Branch deployment policy to deploy the new code to a Puppet environment with the same name as the branch where the new code is housed. If a Puppet environment by this name doesn't exist at the time of deployment, Continuous Delivery for PE creates it for you.

-   **Manually trigger a regex branch pipeline.** You can now start a pipeline run on a regex branch pipeline by clicking **Run Pipeline** ![](trigger-pipeline.png).

-   **Onboarding guide for first-time users.** New users are now greeted by a guided path through the integrations and setup tasks required to get started with Continuous Delivery for PE.

## Version 2.4.0

Released 21 February 2019

New in this release:

-   **Fewer inputs required for PE integration.** We've simplified the process for integrating your PE instance with Continuous Delivery for PE, and no longer require you to manually generate an API token, enter your endpoints, or paste in your CA certificate. See [Add your Puppet Enterprise credentials](integrate_with_puppet_enterprise.md#) for details.

-   **Regex branch pipelines.** You can now create a pipeline for branches in your control repo or module that aren't associated with an existing pipeline, and have names matching the regular expression you set. Only one regex branch pipeline is allowed per module or control repo. To create a regex branch pipeline, click **+ Add Pipeline** and select **Branch Regex**.

-   **Improved controls for adding pipeline stages.** Previously, you could add stages only to the bottom of your pipeline. This release introduces the **More Actions** ![](kebab.png) menu to every pipeline stage, which includes the options to add a stage before or after any stage.

-   **Hiera 3 support.** Continuous Delivery for PE now supports use of Hiera 3.

-   **Deployment approval notifications in the message center.** Notifications of deployments to protected environments that require approval are now shown in the message center. Members of the approval group will also continue to receive email notifications.
