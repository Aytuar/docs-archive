# Deploying Puppet code

-   **[Deployment policies](deployment_policies.md#)**  
Deployment policies are prescriptive workflows for Puppet code deployment that are built into Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise \(PE\). You select the best deployment policy for your situation, and Continuous Delivery for PEÂ does all the Git heavy lifting for you, so your code is quickly and easily deployed to the right nodes.
