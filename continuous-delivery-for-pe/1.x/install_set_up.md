# Installing

In order for your organization to begin using Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise, you must first complete the initial installation and setup process.

-   **[System requirements](cd_system_requirements.md#)**  
Refer to these system requirements for your Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) installation.
-   **[Generate a license](generating_a_license.md)**  
 Puppet License Manager is the centralized hub for purchasing and tracking licenses for many Puppet products, including Continuous Delivery for PE. Use Puppet License Manager to generate a free 30-day trial license for Continuous Delivery for PE.
-   **[Install Continuous Delivery for PE](installing_continuous_delivery.md)**  
Much like Puppet Enterprise \(PE\), Continuous Delivery for PE should be installed in a central location by an administrator. Installing Continuous Delivery for PE requires you to pull and run a Docker container, then follow our guided setup to create the root account and configure your installation. Â
