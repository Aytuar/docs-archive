# Archive documentation for Puppet and its components

This repository is the final resting place of some of our older documentation that is no longer hosted on docs.puppet.com and didn't make the migration to puppet.com/docs.

## How to use

You can access each archived version of any component in its top-level directory here on github, or clone and download the repo and uncompress the tarball to view the docs in your local browser.

Because these docs were never meant to be published in this manner, most links on pages won't work, and there's no sidebar of navigation for pages in the same section you're viewing. We suggest a browser extension such as (Octotree)[https://github.com/ovity/octotree] to improve your viewing experience.
