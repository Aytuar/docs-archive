# Archive documentation for Puppet and its components

This repository is the final resting place of some of our older documentation that is no longer hosted on docs.puppet.com and didn't make the migration to puppet.com/docs.

You can access each archived version of any component in its top-level directory here on github, or clone and download the repo and uncompress the tarball to view the docs in your local browser.
