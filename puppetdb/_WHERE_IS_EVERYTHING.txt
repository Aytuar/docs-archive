Newer versions of the PuppetDB docs actually live in the PuppetDB GitHub
repository (https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb), in a directory called
`documentation`. When we build the website, we add docs for all PuppetDB
versions by cloning the repo, creating working dirs for each PuppetDB version,
and symlinking their documentation directories into place.

To see which branch you need to update to affect a version of the PuppetDB docs,
see the `externalsources` section of the source/_config.yml file.
