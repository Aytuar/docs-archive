The Puppet Server docs actually live in the Puppet Server GitHub repository
(https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-server), in a directory called
`documentation`. When we build the website, we add docs for all Puppet Server
versions by cloning the repo, creating working dirs for each Puppet Server
version, and symlinking their documentation directories into place.

To see which branch you need to update to affect a version of the Puppet Server
docs, see the `externalsources` section of the source/_config.yml file.
