# Puppet License Manager

Puppet License Manager is a centralized hub for self-service generation of trial licenses for five Puppet products. Sign into Puppet License Manager and use it to create and manage license files for Pipelines for Applications, Pipelines for Containers, Puppet Container Registry, Puppet Discovery, and Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise.

## Create a personal Puppet account

To use Puppet License Manager, you must create a Puppet account. The credentials for this account are also used to sign into the Puppet-hosted versions of Pipelines for Applications, Pipelines for Containers, and Puppet Container Registry.

1.  Navigate to [licenses.puppet.com](https://licenses.puppet.com/).

2.  Click **Sign Up** and fill out the registration form.

3.  Click **Sign Up**.


Your account is created, and the main license management screen opens.

**Important:** If you need to change your password, you can do so from the Puppet License Manager login screen. Remember that this password is also used to sign into the Puppet-hosted versions of Pipelines for Applications, Pipelines for Containers, and Puppet Container Registry.

## Create a team Puppet account

If you wish to share access to product licenses with other members of your team or organization, create a team account. 

Each member of the team must create a personal Puppet account. 

1.  Navigate to [licenses.puppet.com](https://licenses.puppet.com/).

2.  Click **Sign Up** and fill out the registration form.

3.  Click **Sign Up**.

4.  Add members to the team account. In the Puppet License Manager web UI, click **Settings** ![](settings_icon.png), then click **Add Account Member**.

5.  Enter the email address of a team member and click **Add User**. Repeat this step for each member of your team. 

6.  When you're finished adding users, click **Cancel** to exit the Add User pane.


The Account Members screen now shows a list of the members of your team account. You can add or remove account members from this screen at any time.

## Access a team Puppet account

After you've been added as a member of a team account, you can switch between your personal and team accounts without logging out of Puppet License Manager. 

1.  Navigate to [licenses.puppet.com](https://licenses.puppet.com/).

2.  Sign into your personal Puppet account.

3.  In the Puppet License Manager web UI, click your username ![](use_icon.png) to open the list of accounts you have access to. You'll see your personal account and any team accounts you're a member of. 

4.  Select a personal or team account username from the list to switch to that account.


The username for the account you're viewing is always displayed in the navigation bar.
