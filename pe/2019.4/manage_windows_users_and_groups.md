# Manage Windows users and groups

Puppet can be used to create local group and user accounts. Local user accounts are often desirable for isolating applications requiring unique permissions.

-   **[Manage administrator accounts](manage_windows_administrator_accounts.md)**  
It is often necessary to standardize the local Windows Administrator password across an entire Windows deployment.
-   **[Configure an app to use a different account](configure_apps_to_use_different_account.md)**  
You might not always want to use the default user for an application, you can use Puppet to create users for other applications, like ASP.NET.
-   **[Manage local groups](manage_local_windows_user_groups.md)**  
Local user accounts are often desirable for isolating applications requiring unique permissions. It can also be useful to manipulate existing local groups.
