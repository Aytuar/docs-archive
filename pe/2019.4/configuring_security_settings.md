# Configuring and tuning security settings

Ensure your PE environment is secure by configuring security settings.

-   **[Configure cipher suites](configuring_cipher_suites.md)**  
Due to regulatory compliance or other security requirements, you may need to change which cipher suites your SSL-enabled PE services use to communicate with other PE components.
-   **[Configure SSL protocols](configuring_ssl_protocols.md)**  
Add or remove SSL protocols in your PE infrastructure.
-   **[Configure RBAC and token-based authentication settings](configuring_rbac.md)**  
Tune RBAC and token-based authentication settings, like setting the number of failed attempts a user has before they are locked out of the console or changing the amount of time a token is valid for.
