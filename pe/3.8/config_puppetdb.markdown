We recommend tuning the following settings as needed to improve the performance of PuppetDB.

### Java Args

You can increase the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) memory that is allocated to Java services running on PuppetDB. This memory allocation is known as the Java heap size.

Instructions for using the PE console to increase the Jave heap size are detailed on on the [Configuring Java Arguments for PE](./config_java_args.html#pe-console-service) page.
