## Versions

**Note:** We've skipped several version numbers in the course of PE's history (there was no 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, or 2016.3), and have changed version numbering schemes a few times. For information on the current versioning scheme, see [Puppet Enterprise Version Numbers](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/pe_and_open_source_version_numbers.html).
