# Next steps

Now that you have set up some basic automated configuration management with PE, here are some things to do next:

-   Check out the [Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/) to download additional modules and start managing other things like [IIS](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/iis) sites or machines running on [Azure](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/azure?_ga=2.25353978.697154119.1582546077-1889953873.1516136880).
-   Learn how to develop high-quality modules with the [Puppet VSCode extension](https://puppet-vscode.github.io/docs/getting-started/) and [Puppet Development Kit \(PDK\)](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/1.x/pdk.html).
-   See the [Configuring Puppet Enterprise](configuring_pe.md) docs to fine-tune things like the console performance, orchestration services, Java, and proxy settings.
-   Learn more about running [Tasks and plans in PE](running_tasks_and_plans_pe.md), or write your own; see [Writing tasks](writing_tasks.md#) and [Writing plans](writing_plans.md).
-   See [Managing access](managing_access.md) for information about adding and organizing other PE users and their permissions.
-   If you have teams rolling out Puppet code changes across your infrastructure, check out [Getting Started with Continuous Delivery for Puppet Enterprise](https://puppet.com/docs/continuous-delivery/2.x/getting_started.html).
-   Check out our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPfMWIY-qNbLhIrbZm2BFMQ) to learn more about Puppet.
