# Practice tasks

In other locations in the documentation, these can be found as steps in tasks, but they are not explained as thoroughly.

-   **[Write a simple manifest](write_a_simple_manifest.md)**  
Puppet manifest files are lists of resources that have a unique title and a set of named attributes that describe the desired state.
-   **[Validate your manifest with puppet parser validate](validate_manifest_with_puppet_parser_validate.md)**  
You can validate that a manifest's syntax is correct by using the command `puppet parser validate`
-   **[Launch the Puppet command prompt](launch_the_puppet_command_prompt.md)**  
A lot of common interactions with Puppet are done via the command line.
-   **[Simulate a Puppet run with --noop](simulate_a_run_with_noop.md)**  
 Puppet has a switch that you can use to test if manifests make the intended changes. This is referred to as non-enforcement or no-op mode.
-   **[Enforce the desired state with puppet apply](enforce_desired_state_w_puppet_apply.md)**  
When the output of the simulation shows the changes you intend to make, you can start enforcing these changes with the `puppet apply` command.
