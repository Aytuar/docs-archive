# Basic tasks and concepts in Windows

This section is meant to help familiarize you with several common tasks used in Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) with Windows agents, and explain the concepts and reasons behind performing them.

-   **[Practice tasks](practice_windows_tasks.md)**  
In other locations in the documentation, these can be found as steps in tasks, but they are not explained as thoroughly.
-   **[Understanding idempotency](understanding_idempotency.md)**  
A key feature of Puppet is its *idempotency*: the ability to repeatedly apply a manifest to guarantee a desired resource state on a system, with the same results every time.
-   **[Additional command line tools](additional_command_line_tools.md)**  
Once you understand how to write manifests, validate them, and use `puppet apply` to enforce your changes, you're ready to use commands such as `puppet agent`, `puppet resource`, and `puppet module install`.
