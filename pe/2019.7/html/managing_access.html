        used to grant individual users the permission to perform specific actions. Permissions are
        grouped into user roles, and each user is assigned at least one user role. </p>
        <p class="p">By using permissions, you give the appropriate level of access and
            agency to each user. For example, you can grant users:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">The permission to grant password reset tokens to other users who
                have forgotten their passwords</li>
            <li class="li">The permission to edit a local user’s metadata</li>
            <li class="li">The permission to deploy Puppet code to specific
                environments</li>
            <li class="li">The permission to edit class parameters in a node group</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">You can do access control tasks in the console or using the RBAC API.

Those roles contain       permissions, which define what a user can or can't do within <span class="ph">PE</span>.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rbac_user_roles_intro.html#creating_and_managing_users_and_user_roles">Creating and managing local users and user roles</a></strong><br>Puppet Enterprise's role-based access control (RBAC)         enables you to manage users—what they can create, edit, or view, and what they can't—in an         organized, high-level way that is vastly more efficient than managing user permissions on a         per-user basis. User roles are sets of permissions you can apply to multiple users. You         can't assign permissions to single users in PE, only to user roles. </li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rbac_ldap_intro.html#connecting_puppet_enterprise_with_external_directory_services">Connecting external directory services to PE</a></strong><br>         <span class="ph">Puppet Enterprise</span> connects to external Lightweight Directory Access         Protocol (LDAP) directory services through its role-based access control (RBAC) service.         Because <span class="ph">PE</span> integrates with cloud LDAP service providers such         as Okta, you can use existing users and user groups that have been set up in your external         directory service. </li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rbac_user_roles_user_groups_ex_dir.html#working_with_user_groups_from_an_external_directory_service">Working with user groups from an external directory service</a></strong><br>You don’t explicitly add remote users to <span class="ph">PE</span>. Instead, after the external directory service has been       successfully connected, remote users must log into <span class="ph">PE</span>, which       creates their user record. </li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rbac_token_auth_intro.html#token_based_authentication">Token-based authentication</a></strong><br>Authentication tokens allow a user to enter their credentials once, then receive an       alphanumeric "token" to use to access different services or parts of the system       infrastructure. Authentication tokens are tied to the permissions granted to the user through       RBAC, and provide the user with the appropriate access to HTTP requests. </li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rbac_api_v1.html">RBAC API v1</a></strong><br>The role-based access control (RBAC) service enables you         to manage users, directory groups, and roles.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="rbac_api_v2_endpoints.html">RBAC API v2</a></strong><br>The role-based access control (RBAC) service enables you         to manage users, directory groups, and roles.</li><li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="activity_api.html">Activity service API</a></strong><br>The activity service logs changes to role-based access         control (RBAC) entities, such as users, directory groups, and user roles. </li></ul></nav></article></main></body></html>
