        <p class="p">It's not a straightforward recipe: you must think hard about the
            nature of your infrastructure and your team. It's also not a final state: expect to
            refine your configurations over time. Instead, it's an approach to <em class="ph i">designing your infrastructure's interface</em> — sealing away incidental
            complexity, surfacing the significant complexity, and making sure your data behaves
            predictably.</p>

                </h2><p class="p">Without roles and profiles, people typically build
                system configurations in their node classifier or main manifest, using <span class="ph">Hiera</span> to handle tricky inheritance problems. A
                standard approach is to create a group of similar nodes and assign classes to it,
                then create child groups with extra classes for nodes that have additional needs.
                Another common pattern is to put everything in <span class="ph">Hiera</span>,
                using a very large hierarchy that reflects every variation in the
                infrastructure.</p><p class="p">If this works for you, then it works! You
                might not need roles and profiles. But most people find direct building gets
                difficult to understand and maintain over time.</p></section>

  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Roles and profiles are <em class="ph i">two
      extra layers of indirection</em> between your node classifier and your component modules. </p>
    <p class="p">The roles and profiles method separates your code into three levels:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Component modules — Normal modules that manage one particular technology, for example
        puppetlabs/apache.</li>
      <li class="li">Profiles — Wrapper classes that use multiple component modules to configure a layered
        technology stack.</li>
      <li class="li">Roles — Wrapper classes that use multiple profiles to build a complete system
        configuration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p">These extra layers of indirection might seem like they add complexity, but they give you a
      space to build practical, business-specific interfaces to the configuration you care most
      about. A better interface makes hierarchical data easier to use, makes system configurations
      easier to read, and makes refactoring easier.</p>
    <br><img class="image" src="roles_and_profiles_overview.png"><br>
    <p class="p">In short, from top to bottom:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Your node classifier assigns one <dfn class="term">role</dfn> class to a group of nodes. The role
        manages a whole system configuration, so no other classes are needed. The node classifier
        does not configure the role in any way.</li>
      <li class="li">That role class declares some <dfn class="term">profile</dfn> classes with <code class="ph codeph">include</code>,
        and does nothing else. For example:
        <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  class role::jenkins::master {
    include profile::base
    include profile::server
    include profile::jenkins::master
  }           </code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Each profile configures a layered technology stack, using multiple component modules and
        the built-in resource types. (In the diagram, <code class="ph codeph">profile::jenkins::master</code> uses
        puppet/jenkins, puppetlabs/apt, a home-built backup module, and some
          <code class="ph codeph">package</code> and <code class="ph codeph">file</code> resources.)</li>
      <li class="li">Profiles can take configuration data from the console, <span class="ph">Hiera</span>, or <span class="ph">Puppet</span> lookup. (In the diagram, three different
        hierarchy levels contribute data.)</li>
      <li class="li">Classes from component modules are always declared via a profile, and never assigned
        directly to a node. <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">If a component class has parameters, you specify them in the profile<em class="ph i">;</em> never use
              <span class="ph">Hiera</span> or <span class="ph">Puppet</span> lookup
            to override component class params. </li>
        </ul>
