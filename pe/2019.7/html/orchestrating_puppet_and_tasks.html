        <span class="ph">Puppet</span> orchestrator is an effective tool for making on-demand
        changes to your infrastructure.</p>
        <p class="p">With orchestrator you can: </p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"> Automate tasks and plans tasks to eliminate manual work across
                your infrastructure and applications. </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">Initiate Puppet jobs whenever you need to update agents. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">Group the servers in your network according to immediate
                    business needs. By leveraging orchestrator with <a class="xref" href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/index.html" target="_blank">PuppetDB</a>, which stores detailed information
                    about your nodes, you can search and filter servers based on metadata. No static
                    lists of hosts, no reliance on complicated host-naming conventions. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">Connect with thousands of hosts at the same time without
                    slowing down your network. The Puppet Communications Protocol (PCP) and message
                    broker efficiently mediate communications on your network even as your
                    operational demands grow.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">Distribute the Puppet agent workload by adding masters that
                    are dedicated to catalog compilation as you increase in scale. Compilers
                    efficiently process requests and compile code for environments that have
                    thousands of nodes. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="installing_compilers.html" title="As your Puppet Enterprise infrastructure scales up to 4,000 nodes and beyond, add load-balanced compilers to your installation to increase the number of agents you can manage.">Installing compilers</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">Take advantage of the tasks installed with <span class="ph">PE</span>. Use the package task to inspect, install,
                    upgrade, and manage packages or the service task to start, stop, restart, and
                    check the status of services running on your systems. Additional tasks are
                    available from the Puppet <a class="xref" href="https://forge.puppet.com/" target="_blank">Forge</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">Write your own tasks in any programming language that your
                    target nodes can run, such as Bash, PowerShell, or Python.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">Write plans in Puppet or YAML or download them from the <a class="xref" href="https://forge.puppet.com/" target="_blank">Forge</a>.</li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p">Integrate server logging, auditing, and per node role-based
                    access control (RBAC). </p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">Use plans to create customized permissions for tasks.</li>
