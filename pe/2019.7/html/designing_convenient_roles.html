  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">There are several approaches to building roles, and you must
    decide which ones are most convenient for you and your team.</p>
    <p class="p">High-quality roles strike a balance between readability and
      maintainability. For most people, the benefit of seeing the entire role in a single file
      outweighs the maintenance cost of repetition. Later, if you find the repetition burdensome,
      you can change your approach to reduce it. This might involve combining several similar roles
      into a more complex role, creating sub-roles that other roles can include, or pushing more
      complexity into your profiles.</p>
    <p class="p">So, begin with granular roles and deviate from them only in small,
      carefully considered steps.</p>
    <p class="p">Here's the basic Jenkins role we're starting with:</p>
    <pre class="pre codeblock puppet"><code>class role::jenkins::master {
  include profile::base
  include profile::server
  include profile::jenkins::master
}</code></pre>

  <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">First approach: Granular roles </h2>
  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The simplest approach is to make one role per type of node,
    period. For example, the <span class="ph">Puppet</span> Release Engineering (RE) team
    manages some additional resources on their Jenkins masters. </p>
    <p class="p">With granular roles, we'd have at least two Jenkins master roles. A basic
      one:</p>
    <pre class="pre codeblock puppet"><code>class role::jenkins::master {
  include profile::base
  include profile::server
  include profile::jenkins::master
}</code></pre>
    <p class="p">...and an RE-specific one:</p>
    <pre class="pre codeblock puppet"><code>class role::jenkins::master::release {
  include profile::base
  include profile::server
  include profile::jenkins::master
  include profile::jenkins::master::release
}</code></pre>
    <p class="p">The benefits of this setup are:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Readability — By looking at a single class, you can immediately see
        which profiles make up each type of node.</li>
      <li class="li">Simplicity — Each role is just a linear list of profiles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p">Some drawbacks are:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Role bloat — If you have a lot of only-slightly-different nodes, you
        quickly have a large number of roles.</li>
      <li class="li">Repetition — The two roles above are almost identical, with one
        difference. If they're two separate roles, it's harder to see how they're related to each
        other, and updating them can be more annoying.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Second approach: Conditional logic </h2>
  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Alternatively, you can use conditional logic to handle
    differences between closely-related kinds of nodes.</p>
    <pre class="pre codeblock puppet"><code>class role::jenkins::master::release {
  include profile::base
  include profile::server
  include profile::jenkins::master

  if $facts['group'] == 'release' {
    include profile::jenkins::master::release
  }
}</code></pre>
    <p class="p">The benefits of this approach are:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">You have fewer roles, and they're easy to maintain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p">The drawbacks are:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Reduced readability...maybe. Conditional logic isn't usually hard to
        read, especially in a simple case like this, but you might feel tempted to add a bunch of
        new custom facts to accommodate complex roles. This can make roles much harder to read,
        because a reader must also know what those facts mean.<p class="p">In short, be
          careful of turning your node classification system inside-out. You might have a better
          time if you separate the roles and assign them with your node classifier.</p></li>

  <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title4">Third approach: Nested roles </h2>
  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Another way of reducing repetition is to let roles include
    other roles. </p>
    <pre class="pre codeblock puppet"><code>class role::jenkins::master {
  # Parent role:
  include role::server
  # Unique classes:
  include profile::jenkins::master
}

class role::jenkins::master::release {
  # Parent role:
  include role::jenkins::master
  # Unique classes:
  include profile::jenkins::master::release
}</code></pre>
    <p class="p">In this example, we reduce boilerplate by having <code class="ph codeph">role::jenkins::master</code> include <code class="ph codeph">role::server</code>. When <code class="ph codeph">role::jenkins::master::release</code> includes <code class="ph codeph">role::jenkins::master</code>, it automatically gets <code class="ph codeph">role::server</code> as well. With this approach, any given role only needs to:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Include the "parent" role that it most resembles.</li>
      <li class="li">Include the small handful of classes that differentiate it from its
        parent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p">The benefits of this approach are:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">You have fewer roles, and they're easy to maintain.</li>
      <li class="li">Increased visibility in your node classifier.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p">The drawbacks are:</p>
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Reduced readability: You have to open more files to see the real
        content of a role. This isn't much of a problem if you go only one level deep, but it can
        get cumbersome around three or four.</li>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title5">Fourth approach: Multiple roles per node </h2>
    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In general, we recommend that you assign only one role to
        a node. In an infrastructure where nodes usually provide one primary service, that's the
        best way to work.</p>
        <p class="p">However, if your nodes tend to provide more than one primary service,
            it can make sense to assign multiple roles.</p>
        <p class="p">For example, say you have a large application that is usually composed
            of an application server, a database server, and a web server. To enable lighter-weight
            testing during development, you've decided to provide an "all-in-one" node type to your
            developers. You could do this by creating a new <code class="ph codeph">role::our_application::monolithic</code> class, which includes all of the
            profiles that compose the three normal roles, but you might find it simpler to use your
            node classifier to assign all three roles (<code class="ph codeph">role::our_application::app</code>, <code class="ph codeph">role::our_application::db</code>, and <code class="ph codeph">role::our_application::web</code>) to those all-in-one machines.</p>
        <p class="p">The benefit of this approach are:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">You have fewer roles, and they're easy to maintain.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">The drawbacks are:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">There's no actual "role" that describes your multi-purpose
                nodes; instead, the source of truth for what's on them is spread out between your
                roles and your node classifier, and you must cross-reference to understand their
                configurations. This reduces readability.</li>
            <li class="li">The normal and all-in-one versions of a complex application are
                likely to have other subtle differences you need to account for, which might mean
                making your "normal" roles more complex. It's possible that making a separate role
                for this kind of node would <em class="ph i">reduce</em> your overall
                complexity, even though it increases the number of roles and adds repetition.</li>
        </ul>

</article><article class="topic concept nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title6" id="fifth_approach_super_profiles">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title6">Fifth approach: Super profiles </h2>
    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Because profiles can already include other profiles, you
        can decide to enforce an additional rule at your business: all profiles must include any
        other profiles needed to manage a complete node that provides that service.</p>
        <p class="p">For example, our <code class="ph codeph">profile::jenkins::master</code> class could include both <code class="ph codeph">profile::server</code> and <code class="ph codeph">profile::base</code>, and you could manage a Jenkins master server
            by directly assigning <code class="ph codeph">profile::jenkins::master</code> in your node classifier. In other words, a "main"
            profile would do all the work that a role usually does, and the roles layer would no
            longer be necessary.</p>
        <p class="p">The benefits of this approach are:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">The chain of dependencies for a complex service can be more
                clear this way.</li>
            <li class="li">Depending on how you conceptualize code, this can be easier in a
                lot of ways!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">The drawbacks are:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Loss of flexibility. This reduces the number of ways in which
                your roles can be combined, and reduces your ability to use alternate
                implementations of dependencies for nodes with different requirements.</li>
            <li class="li">Reduced readability, on a much grander scale. Like with nested
                roles, you lose the advantage of a clean, straightforward list of what a node
                consists of. Unlike nested roles, you also lose the clear division between
                "top-level" complete system configurations (roles) and "mid-level" groupings of
                technologies (profiles). Not every profile makes sense as an entire system, so you
                some way to keep track of which profiles are the top-level ones.<p class="p">Some people really find continuous hierarchies easier to reason about than
                    sharply divided layers. If everyone in your organization is on the same page
                    about this, a "profiles and profiles" approach might make sense. But we strongly
                    caution you against it unless you're very sure; for most people, a true roles
                    and profiles approach works better. Try the well-traveled path first.</p></li>

    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Instead of building roles with the <span class="ph">Puppet</span> language and then assigning them to nodes with your
        node classifier, you might find your classifier flexible enough to build roles
        directly.</p>
        <p class="p"> For example, you might create a "Jenkins masters" group in the
            console and assign it the <code class="ph codeph">profile::base</code>, <code class="ph codeph">profile::server</code>, and <code class="ph codeph">profile::jenkins::master</code> classes, doing much the same job as our basic
                <code class="ph codeph">role::jenkins::master</code> class.</p>
        <div class="p"><div class="note important note_important"><span class="note__title">Important:</span> <p class="p">If
                    you're doing this, make sure you don't set parameters for profiles in the
                    classifier. Continue to use <span class="ph">Hiera</span> / <span class="ph">Puppet</span> lookup to configure profiles.</p><p class="p">This is because profiles are allowed to include other
                    profiles, which interacts badly with the resource-like behavior that node
                    classifiers use to set class parameters.</p></div></div>
        <p class="p">The benefits of this approach are:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Your node classifier becomes much more powerful, and can be a
