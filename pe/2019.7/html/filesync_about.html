    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">File sync helps <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> keep your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code synchronized
        across multiple masters.</p>
        <p class="p">When triggered by a web endpoint, file sync takes changes from your
            working directory on your master and deploys the code to a live code directory. File
            sync then automatically deploys that code onto all your compilers, ensuring that all
            masters in a multi-master configuration are kept in sync.</p>
        <p class="p">In addition, file sync ensures that your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code is deployed only when it is ready.
            These deployments ensure that your agents' code won't change during a run. File sync
            also triggers an environment cache flush when the deployment has finished, to ensure
            that new agent runs happen against the newly deployed <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code.</p>
        <p class="p">File sync works with <span class="ph">Code Manager</span>, so you typically won't need to do anything with file sync directly. If
            you want to know more about how file sync works, or you need to work with file sync
            directly for testing, this page provides additional information.</p>

   <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">There are a few terms that are helpful when you are working

                  sync moves the changes to the live code dir on all of your masters. This directory
                  exists only on the master; compilers do not need a staging directory. The default

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">How file sync works </h2>
    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">File sync helps distribute your code to all of your
        masters and agents.</p>
        <p class="p">By default, file sync is disabled and the staging directory is not
            created on the master. If you're upgrading from 2015.2 or earlier, file sync is disabled
            after the upgrade. You must enable file sync, and then run <span class="ph">Puppet</span> on all masters. This creates the staging directory
            on the master, which you can then populate with your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code. File sync can then commit your code; that is, it can prepare the code for
            synchronization to the live code directory, and then your compilers. Normally, <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> triggers this commit automatically, but you can
            trigger a commit by hitting the file sync endpoint. </p>
        <p class="p">For example:</p>
        <pre class="pre codeblock bash"><code>/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/curl -s --request POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"commit-all": true}' --cert ${cert} --key ${key} --cacert ${cacert} https://${fqdn}:8140/file-sync/v1/commit"</code></pre>
        <p class="p">The above command is run from the master and contains the following
            variables:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">fqdn</code>: Fully
                qualified domain name of the master.</li>
            <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">cacert</code>: The <span class="ph">Puppet</span> CA's certificate (<code class="ph codeph">/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem</code>).</li>
            <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">cert</code>: The ssl
                cert for the master (<code class="ph codeph">/etc/puppetlabs/ssl/certs/${fqdn}.pem</code>).</li>
            <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">key</code>: The
                private key for the master (<code class="ph codeph">/etc/puppetlabs/ssl/private_keys/${fqdn}.pem</code>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">This command commits all of the changes in the staging directory.
            After the commit, when any compilers check the file sync service for changes, they
            receive the new code and deploy it into their own code directories, where it is
            available for agents checking in to those masters. (By default, compilers check file
            sync every 5 seconds.) </p>
        <p class="p">Commits can be restricted to a specific environment and can include
            details such as a message, and information about the commit author. </p>

If you set this parameter to <code class="ph codeph">true</code>, it forces file sync to be enabled even if <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> is disabled. The <code class="ph codeph">file_sync_enabled</code> parameter doesn't appear in the
