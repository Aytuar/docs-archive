            <p class="p">When you go above your node license's count limit, you enter what is called the
                    <dfn class="term">bursting limit</dfn>. The bursting limit lets you to exceed the number of
                nodes allowed under your license and enter a new threshold without extra charge. You
                are allowed to use your bursting limit on four consecutive or non-consecutive days
                per calendar month. Any higher usage beyond the four days will require you to either
                purge nodes or buy a license for more nodes. </p>
            <div class="p">The amount of time within your bursting limit does not matter for it to be counted as
                one day. For example, assuming you are licensed to use 1000 nodes and your bursting
                limit is 2000 nodes: <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">If you use 1200 nodes for two hours one day, you have three days left to use
                        your bursting limit that month. </li>
                    <li class="li">If you use 1900 nodes for 23 hours one day, you have three days left to use
                        your bursting limit that month. </li>
                    <li class="li">If you use 1500 nodes for one hour each day for four days, you must contact
                        your Puppet representative to buy a license for more nodes or purge some of
                        your nodes until the next calendar month. </li>

            <p class="p">The same time is used for the calendar month. For example, the month of September
                would include activity from 12:00 midnight UTC 01 September until 12:00 midnight UTC
                01 October. After that point, the bursting limit restarts with a fresh four days in
