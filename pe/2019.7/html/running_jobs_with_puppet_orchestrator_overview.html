    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">With the <span class="ph">Puppet</span> orchestrator, you can run three types
        of "jobs": on-demand Puppet jobs, task runs, and plan runs. </p>
        <p class="p">When you run <span class="ph">Puppet</span> on-demand with the orchestrator, you
            control the rollout of configuration changes when and how you want them. You control
            when Puppet jobs runs and where node catalogs are applied (from the environment level to
            an individual node). You no longer need to wait on arbitrary run times to update your
            nodes. </p>
        <p class="p">Puppet tasks allow you to execute actions on target machines. A "task" is a single action
            that you execute on the target via an executable file. For example, do you want to
            upgrade a package or restart a particular service? Set up a Puppet task run to enforce
            to make those changes at will.</p>
        <p class="p">Puppet plans are bundles of tasks that can be combined with other logic. They allow you
            to do complex task operations, like running multiple tasks with one command or
            automatically running certain tasks based on the output of another task. </p>
        <p class="p">Tasks and plans are packaged and distributed as Puppet modules.</p>
