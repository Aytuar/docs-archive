    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">
        <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> uses <span class="ph">r10k</span> and the file
        sync service to stage, commit, and sync your code, automatically managing your environments
        and modules. </p>
        <p class="p">First, create a control repository with branches for each environment
            that you want to create (such as production, development, or testing). Create a <span class="ph">Puppetfile</span> for each of your environments, specifying
            exactly which modules to install in each environment. This allows <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> to create directory environments, based on the
            branches you've set up. When you push code to your control repo, you trigger <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> to pull that new code into a staging code
            directory (<code class="ph codeph">/etc/puppetlabs/code-staging</code>). File sync then picks up those changes, pauses
                <span class="ph">Puppet Server</span> to avoid conflicts, and then syncs the new
            code to the live code directories on your masters.</p>
        <p class="p">For more information about using environments in <span class="ph">Puppet</span>, see <a class="xref" href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.10/environments_about.html" target="_blank">About Environments</a>.</p>

   <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">Understanding file sync and the staging directory </h2>
   
   <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">To sync your code across multiple masters and to make sure
      that code stays consistent, <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> relies on file sync and two
      different code directories: the staging directory and the live code directory.</p>
      <p class="p">Without <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> or file sync, <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code lives in the codedir, or live code directory, at
            <code class="ph codeph">/etc/puppetlabs/code</code>. But the file sync
         service looks for code in a code staging directory (<code class="ph codeph">/etc/puppetlabs/code-staging</code>), and then syncs that to the live codedir. </p>
      <p class="p"><span class="ph">Code Manager</span> moves new code from source
         control into the staging directory, and then file sync moves it into the live code
         directory. This means you no longer write code to the codedir; if you do, the next time <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> deploys code from source control, it overwrites your
         changes.</p>
      <p class="p">For more detailed information about how file sync works, see the related
         topic about file sync.</p>
      <div class="p">
         <div class="note caution note_caution"><span class="note__title">CAUTION:</span> 
            <p class="p">Don't directly modify code in the staging directory. <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> overwrites it with updates from the control
               repo. Similarly, don't modify code in the live code directory, because file sync
               overwrites that with code from the staging directory.</p>

    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Both your live and staging code directories contain
        metadata files that are generated by file sync to provide environment isolation for your
        resource types. </p>
        <p class="p">These files, which have a <code class="ph codeph">.pp</code> extension, ensure that each environment uses the correct version of
            the resource type. Do not delete or modify these files. Do not use expressions from
            these files in regular manifests.</p>
        <p class="p">These files are generated as <span class="ph">Code Manager</span>
            deploys new code in your environments. If you are new to <span class="ph">Code Manager</span>, these files are generated when you first deploy
            your environments. If you already use <span class="ph">Code Manager</span>, the files
            are generated as you make and deploy changes to your existing environments.</p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Code Manager</span> uses <span class="ph">r10k</span> in the background to improve automation of your code
