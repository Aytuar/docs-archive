 <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Use the orchestrator to run tasks and plans in the console or on the command
  line.</p>
  <div class="p">You can install pre-existing tasks and plans and run them from the console
   and from the command line. <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> If you have set up compilers and you want
    to use tasks and/or plans, you must either set <code class="ph codeph">master_uris</code> or you <code class="ph codeph">server_list</code> on agents to point to your compilers. This setting is
    described in the section on configuring compilers for orchestrator scale.</div></div>
  <p class="p">A <em class="ph i">task</em> is a single action that you execute
   on target machines. With tasks, you can troubleshoot and deploy changes to individual or multiple
   systems in your infrastructure. </p>
  <p class="p">A <em class="ph i">plan</em> is a bundle of tasks that can be
   combined with other logic. They allow you to do complex task operations, like running multiple
   tasks with one command or running certain tasks based on the output of another task. </p>
  <p class="p">You can run tasks and plans from your tool of choice: the console, the
   orchestrator command line interface (CLI), or the orchestrator API <code class="ph codeph">/command/task</code> and <code class="ph codeph">/command/plan_jobs</code> endpoint.</p>
  <p class="p">You can launch a task or plan and check on the status or view the output
   later with the console or CLI. </p>
  <p class="p">Running a task or plan does not update your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> configuration. If you run a task or plan that changes the
   state of a resource that <span class="ph">Puppet</span> is managing, a subsequent <span class="ph">Puppet</span> run changes the state of that resource back to what is defined
   in your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> configuration. For example, if you use a task to
   update the version of a managed package, the version of that package is reset to whatever is
   specified in a manifest on the next <span class="ph">Puppet</span> run.</p>
  <div class="p">
   <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> If you are running multiple tasks and plans, make sure your concurrency limit for tasks and
    bolt-server can accommodate your needs.

  <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">RBAC for tasks and plans</h2>
   
   <p class="p">Tasks rely on role-based access control (RBAC) to determine who can run
    which tasks on your infrastructure. You can delegate access, even on a per-task basis, to ensure
    that teams or individuals can run task and plan jobs only on infrastructure they manage. </p>
   <p class="p">RBAC for plans and tasks do <strong class="ph b">not</strong>
    intersect. This means that if a user does not have access to a specific task but they have
    access to run a plan containing that task, they are still able to run the plan. This allows you
    to implement more customized security options by wrapping tasks within plans. Read more about
    RBAC considerations for writing plans <a class="xref" href="writing_plans_in_puppet_language_pe.html#rbac_writing_plans" title="Take user permissions into consideration when writing plans by understanding how RBAC for plans works.">here</a>. </p>
