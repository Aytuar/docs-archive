    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">An event occurs whenever PE attempts to modify an
        individual property of a given resource. Reviewing events lets you see detailed information
        about what has changed on your system, or what isn't working properly. </p>
        <p class="p">During a Puppet run, Puppet compares the current state of each
            property on each resource to the desired state for that property, as defined by the
            node's catalog. If Puppet successfully compares the states and the property is already
            in sync (in other words, if the current state is the desired state), Puppet moves on to
            the next resource without noting anything. Otherwise, it attempts some action and
            records an event, which appears in the report it sends to the Puppet master at the end
            of the run. These reports provide the data presented on the <span class="keyword wintitle">Events</span> page in the console.</p>

            failure in the <span class="keyword wintitle">Events</span>
