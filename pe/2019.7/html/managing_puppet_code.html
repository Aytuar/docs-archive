   <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">
      <span class="ph">Puppet Enterprise (PE)</span> includes built-in tools for managing and deploying
      your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> infrastructure. <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> and <span class="ph">r10k</span> are code
      management tools that automatically install modules, create and maintain environments, and
      deploy new code to your masters, all based on version control of your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code and data.</p>
      <p class="p">Code management tools use <span class="ph">Git</span> version
         control to track, maintain, and deploy your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> modules,
         manifests, and data. This allows you to more easily maintain, update, review, and deploy
            <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code and data for multiple environments.</p>
      <p class="p">
         <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> automates the deployment of your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code and data. You make code and data changes on your
         workstation, push changes to your <span class="ph">Git</span> repository, and then
            <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> creates environments, installs modules, and
         deploys the new code to your masters, without interrupting agent runs. </p>
      <p class="p">If you are already using <span class="ph">r10k</span> to manage
         your Puppet code, we suggest that you upgrade to <span class="ph">Code Manager</span>.
            <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> works in concert with <span class="ph">r10k</span>, so when you switch to <span class="ph">Code Manager</span>, you no longer interact directly with <span class="ph">r10k</span>.</p>
      <p class="p">If you're using <span class="ph">r10k</span> and aren't ready to
         switch to <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> yet, you can continue using <span class="ph">r10k</span> alone. You push your code changes to your version
         control repo, deploy environments from the command line, and <span class="ph">r10k</span> creates environments and installs the modules for each
         one.</p>
      <div class="p">Both <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> and the <span class="ph">r10k</span> code management tool are built into <span class="ph">PE</span>, so you don't have to install anything. To begin managing
         your code with either of these tools, you perform the following tasks: <ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p">Create a control repository with <span class="ph">Git</span> for maintaining your environments and code. </p>
               <p class="p">The control repository is the <span class="ph">Git</span> repository that code management uses to maintain and deploy your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code and data and to create environments in
                  your <span class="ph">Puppet</span> infrastructure. As you update your
                  control repo, code management keeps each of your environments updated. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p">Set up a <span class="ph">Puppetfile</span> to manage
                  content in your environment. </p>
               <p class="p">This file specifies which modules and data to install in your
                  environment, including what version of that content to install, and where to
                  download the content from.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p">Configure <span class="ph">Code Manager</span> (recommended)
                  or <span class="ph">r10k</span>. </p>
               <p class="p">Configure code management in the console's master profile. If
                  you need to customize your configuration further, you can do so by adding keys to
                     <span class="ph">Hiera</span>. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p">Deploy environments. With <span class="ph">Code Manager</span>, either set up a deployment trigger (recommended), or plan to trigger your
                  deployment from the command line, which is useful for initial configuration. If
                  you are using <span class="ph">r10k</span> alone, run it from the command
                  line whenever you want to deploy. </p>
            </li>
