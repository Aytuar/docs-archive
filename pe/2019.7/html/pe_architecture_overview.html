    <p class="p">
      <span class="ph">PE</span> infrastructure components are installed on a single node:
      the <dfn class="term">master</dfn>. The master always contains a compiler and a <span class="ph">Puppet Server</span>. As your installation grows, you can add additional

    <p class="p">Each compiler contains the <span class="ph">Puppet Server</span>, the

    <section class="section" id="the_master_and_compilers__puppet_server"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Puppet Server
        </h3><p class="p"><span class="ph">Puppet Server</span> is an application that

    <section class="section" id="the_master_and_compilers__catalog_compiler"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Catalog
        compiler </h3><p class="p">To configure a managed node, the agent uses a
        document called a catalog, which it downloads from the master or a compiler. The catalog
        describes the desired state for each resource that should be managed on the node, and it can
        specify dependency information for resources that should be managed in a certain

        </h3><p class="p">File sync keeps your code synchronized across multiple
        compilers. When triggered by a web endpoint, file sync takes changes from the working
        directory on the master and deploys the code to a live code directory. File sync then
        deploys that code to any compilers, ensuring that all masters in a multi-master
        configuration are kept in sync, and that your code is deployed only when it's

            your managed nodes by assigning classes to them. <strong class="ph b">Classes</strong> provide the <span class="ph">Puppet</span> code—distributed in
            modules—that enable you to define the function of a managed node, or apply specific
            settings and values to it. For example, you might want all of your managed nodes to have
            time synchronized across them. In this case, you would group the nodes in the NC, apply
            an NTP class to the group, and set a parameter on that class to point at a specific NTP
            server. </p><p class="p">You can create your own classes, or you can take

            service is and how they connect, so that you can cleanly bring up the application. You
            then want the load balancer to automatically configure itself to balance demand on a
