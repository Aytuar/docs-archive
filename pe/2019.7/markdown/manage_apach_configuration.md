# Manage Apache configuration on \*nix targets

-   **[Add a module](add_modules.md#)**  
Modules are self-contained, shareable bundles of code and data. Each module manages a specific task in your infrastructure, like installing and configuring a piece of software. You can write your own modules or download pre-built modules from the Forge. While you can use any module available on the Forge, PE customers can take advantage of supported modules. These modules are designed to make common services easier, and are tested and maintained by Puppet. A lot of your infrastructure will be supported by modules, so it is important to learn how to install, build, and use them.
-   **[Configure your desired state](configure_desired_state.md#)**  
Tell PE how your infrastructure should be configured by grouping and classifying nodes based on their function. Before you begin, think of which of your inventory nodes you want to configure with Apacheservices.
-   **[Organize webserver configurations with roles and profiles](configure_roles_and_profiles_apache_getting_started.md#)**  
The roles and profiles method is a reliable way to build reusable, configurable, and refactorable system configurations.
