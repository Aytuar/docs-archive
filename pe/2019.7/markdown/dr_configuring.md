# Configuring disaster recovery

Enabling disaster recovery for Puppet Enterprise ensures that your systems can fail over to a replica of your master if infrastructure components become unreachable.

-   **[Disaster recovery](dr_overview.md#)**  
Disaster recovery creates a replica of your master.
-   **[Configure disaster recovery](dr_configure.md#)**  
To configure disaster recovery, you must provision a replica to serve as backup during failovers. If your master is permanently disabled, you can then promote a replica.
