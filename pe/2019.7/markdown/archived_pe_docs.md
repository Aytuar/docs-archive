# Archived PE docs

PE docs for recent end-of-life \(EOL\) or superseded product versions are archived in place, meaning that we continue to host them at their original URLs, but we limit their visibility on the main docs site and no longer update them. You can access archived-in-place docs using their original URLs, or from the links here.

PE docs for EOL versions earlier than those listed here are archived in our [PE docs GitHub archive](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/tree/master/pe).
