# Installing compilers

As your Puppet Enterprise infrastructure scales up to 4,000 nodes and beyond, add load-balanced compilers to your installation to increase the number of agents you can manage.

Each compiler increases capacity by 1,500 to 3,000 nodes, until you exhaust the capacity of PuppetDB or the console.
