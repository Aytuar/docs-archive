# Before you begin \(Windows users only\)

Install an SSH client and set up SSH communications between your Windows workstation and your \*nix Puppet master. The examples below use the [Putty SSH client](https://putty.org/).

1.  Open the SSH client, and enter the hostname or IP address and port of the \*nix machine that you want to use as your master. You can then open an SSH session to the \*nix machine where you will install the master.

2.  When prompted in the terminal, log into the \*nix node as the `root` user.
