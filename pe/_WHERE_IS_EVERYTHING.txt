Newer versions of the Puppet Enterprise docs (3.7 and up) actually live in the
pe-docs-private GitHub repository
(https://github.com/puppetlabs/pe-docs-private), in a directory called `source`.
When we build the website, we add docs for these versions by cloning the repo,
creating working dirs for each Puppet Enterprise version, and symlinking their
source directories into place.

THIS REPOSITORY IS PRIVATE TO PUPPET LABS STAFF. To request changes to the
Puppet Enterprise docs, please file a documentation ticket at
https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/DOCUMENT/

Puppet Labs staff: To see which branch you need to update to affect a version of
the Puppet Enterprise docs, see the `externalsources` section of the
source/_config.yml file.
