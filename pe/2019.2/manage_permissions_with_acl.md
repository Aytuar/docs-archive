# Manage permissions with `acl`

The `puppetlabs-acl` module helps you manage access control lists \(ACLs\), which provide a way to interact with permissions for the Windows file system. This module enables you to set basic permissions up to very advanced permissions using SIDs \(Security Identifiers\) with an access mask, inheritance, and propagation strategies. First, start with querying some existing permissions.

ACL is a custom type and provider, so you can use `puppet resource` to look at existing file and folder permissions.
