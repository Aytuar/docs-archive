# Getting started with Puppet Enterprise on Windows

Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) is automation software that can help you and your organization be productive and agile while managing your IT infrastructure.

**Important:** For the most part, interacting with Puppet is the same regardless of your operating system. The key difference between other operating systems and Windows is that you cannot configure a Windows machine to be a Puppet master. Agent components can be installed on Windows machines and you can manage those machines with your Linux master.
