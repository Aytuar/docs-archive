# Next steps

Now that you have your system up and running with PE, here are some recommendations on where to go next.

-   Check out the [Forge](https://forge.puppet.com/) to download additional modules and start managing other things like [IIS](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/iis) sites or machines running on [Azure](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/azure).
-   Learn how to develop high-quality modules with the [Puppet VSCode extension](https://puppet-vscode.github.io/docs/getting-started/) and the [Puppet Development Kit \(PDK\)](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/1.x/pdk.html).
-   See the [Configuring Puppet Enterprise](configuring_pe.md) docs to fine-tune things like the console, orchestration services, java, and proxy settings.
-   See the docs on [Managing nodes](managing_nodes.md) to add more nodes to your inventory and classify them.
-   Learn about [Managing and deploying Puppet code](managing_puppet_code.md).
-   Check out our [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPfMWIY-qNbLhIrbZm2BFMQ).
