# Puppet Enterprise database maintenance

You can optimize the Puppet Enterprise \(PE\) databases to improve performance.

-   **[Databases in Puppet Enterprise](databases_in_pe.md)**  
 PE uses PostgreSQL as the backend for its databases. Use the native tools in PostgreSQL to perform database exports and imports.
-   **[Optimize a database](optimize_a_database.md)**  
If your databases are slow, begin taking up too much disk space, or need general performance enhancements, use the PostgreSQL `vacuum` command to optimize any of the PE databases.
-   **[List all database names](generate_a_list_of_database_names.md)**  
Use these instructions to list all database names.
