# Using Bolt

Bolt is an open source task runner that automates the manual work that you do to maintain your infrastructure.

Use Bolt to automate tasks that you perform on your infrastructure on an as-needed basis, for example, when you troubleshoot a system, deploy an application, or stop and restart services. Bolt connects directly to remote nodes with SSH or WinRM, so you are not required to install any agent software.

While you install Bolt separately from Puppet Enterprise, you can configure it to use orchestrator and run it on PE-managed nodes.

-   **[Using Bolt with orchestrator](bolt_configure_orchestrator.md#)**  
 Bolt enables running a series of tasks — called plans — to help you automate the manual work of maintaining your infrastructure. When you pair Bolt with PE, you get advanced automation with the management and logging capabilities of PE.
