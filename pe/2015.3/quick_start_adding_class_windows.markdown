### Overview

[windows_add_group]: ./images/quick/windows_add_group.png

Every module contains one or more **classes**. [Classes](/{{puppet}}/reference/lang_classes.html) are named chunks of Puppet code and are the primary means by which Puppet Enterprise configures nodes. The Puppet Labs wsus_client module you installed in the [Module Installation QSG](./quick_start_module_install_windows.html) contains a class called `wsus_client`. In this example, youâ€™ll use the `wsus_client` class to supply the types and providers necessary to schedule updates using a WSUS server with Puppet.

In this example, you create a group called __windows_example__ and add the `wsus_client` class to it.

>**Prerequisites**: This guide assumes you've already [installed a monolithic PE deployment](./quick_start_install_mono.html), and have installed at least one [Windows agent node](./quick_start_install_agents_windows.html) and the [puppetlabs-wsus_client module](./quick_start_module_install_windows.html).

>**Note**: The process for adding classes to agent nodes in the console is the same on both Windows and *nix operating systems.

### Create the windows_example group

1. From the console, click __Nodes__ > __Classification__.
2. Click __Add group__.
3. In the __Group name__ field, name your group (e.g., windows_example).
4. Click __Add__.
5. Select the __windows_example__ group.
6. On the __Rules__ tab, in the __Certname__ field, enter the name of the PE-managed node you'd like to add to this group.
6. Click __Pin node__.

__Note__: Pinning a node adds the node to the group regardless of any rules specified for a node group. A pinned node remains in the node group until you manually remove it. [Adding nodes dynamically]({{pe}}/console_classes_groups.html#adding-nodes-dynamically) describes how to use rules to add nodes to a node group.

7. Click __Commit 1 change__.

8. Repeat steps 5-7 for any additional nodes you want to add.


### Add the `wsus_client` class to the example group

1. From the console, click __Nodes__ > __Classification__.

2. Select the __windows_example__ group.

3. Click the __Classes__ tab.

4. In the __Add new class__ field, begin typing `wsus`, and select __wsus_client__ from the autocomplete list. If __wsus_client__ doesn't appear in the list, you might have to click __Refresh__.

5. Click __Add class__.

6. Click __Commit 1 change__.

   Note that the `wsus_client` class now appears in the list of classes for your agent node.

9. Puppet runs, which configures the __windows_ example__ group using the newly-assigned class. Wait one or two minutes.
